#!/bin/bash

docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name dokuwiki dokuwiki

# create data container
docker run --volumes-from dokuwiki --name dokuwiki-data busybox


# you basically have a container whose purpose is to be a placeholder
# volumes-from mounts the data volumes of dokuwiki container into dokuwiki-data
# so now when dokuwiki goes down, those volumes dont
# its a container that basically stores data
# so its basically a directory
# it binds teh data volume from on container to another
# so it takes the data volume of dokuwiki, which is probably empty to start
# and shares it with another container
# so when dokuwiki goes up and down, that volume persists

# when a container is created/run, a data volume is created within it
# data volumes exist within containers, but they are also abstractions
# data volumes will persist if owned by any containers
# so, the idea is that you make a container whose existance is simply to hold that volume

 # you'll need to mount docker.sock into the container
